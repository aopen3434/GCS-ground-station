Build you own Ground station. 
GCS server Wifi enabled Xbee with bluetooth modules. The Idea is to be 
able to connect to your multi copter no weirs from a mobile phone or PC, 
tablet no matter what Operating system is being used. I have been working 
on this for some time. I have this running on a UNO with a double xbee 
shield, 2.4 xbee, xbee wifly module, Bluetooth wifly module. I would Like 
to add a web server to the mix to to display GCS data via Http or PHP. 
I found this Rascal board that uses python that built to do 
just what I am proposing. Hearer is the code I have so fare no web services yet.
